# VRsus guARdian
VRsus guARdian is a networked, stealth-based game between AR and PC. The game utilizes ARKit to scan the room around the player and builds a shared world where both players can interact with one another. The game sets a 'VR Player' who's trying to steal a relic against an 'AR Player' who uses an iPad to set up traps and search for this thief.
