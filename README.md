# VRsus guARdian
VRsus guARdian is a cat-and-mouse chase where one player plays using an AR-enabled device and another player utilizes a VR system. The goal of the AR Player is to track down the other player and shoot them down, while the goal of the VR Player is to snatch relics placed around the world and escape before getting defeated.
